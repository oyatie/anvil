//! Reading Rust source as CODE, with its commentary and literal bodies removed.
//!
//! # Why this is one function and not eight
//!
//! Eight implementations of "strip commentary before scanning" existed in this
//! tree under four different behaviours and one name: a four-line filter that
//! drops whole `//` lines, a per-line truncation with a crude quote guard, a
//! line-wise lexer that tracks string literals, and this -- a whole-source state
//! machine that also handles block comments, escapes, and literals spanning
//! lines.
//!
//! That is worse than duplication. A reader seeing `code_only` assumes the
//! strong one and may be handed the weakest, and the failure is silent: a scan
//! that reads a doc comment as code reports a defect that is not there, and one
//! that misses a construct reports nothing at all. Both happened. The
//! line-wise variant could not see that `both_sides(..)` appeared inside a
//! string spanning several lines, so a gate accused its own ledger's prose of
//! being a call site.
//!
//! # Offsets are preserved
//!
//! Everything removed is replaced by spaces rather than deleted, so a byte
//! offset into the result is the same offset in the original. A scanner can
//! report a line and column from it without a second pass.
//!
//! # What it does not model
//!
//! Raw strings (`r#"..."#`) and a quote inside a character literal. Both are
//! stated rather than implied, because the point of a mechanism is to not
//! overclaim its coverage: either could hide a hit, and neither can invent one.
